## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dexun!

I'm a Data Science & Analytics student at NUS who enjoys working with real-world data to build things that actually get used. Whether it's cleaning pipelines, deploying ML models, or designing dashboards, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to turn data into decisions.

ðŸ§  **Recently worked on**  
â€¢ A Reddit toxicity detection bot using BERT + PyTorch  
â€¢ Live Tableau dashboards powered by BigQuery and SQL  
â€¢ Automation scripts to streamline ETL and reduce cloud costs  

ðŸ“Š **Current focus areas**  
â€¢ Applied machine learning and NLP  
â€¢ A/B testing and statistical inference  
â€¢ Building robust, end-to-end data workflows  

ðŸš€ **What I'm excited about**  
â€¢ Using data to drive product and business impact  
â€¢ Collaborating on meaningful, data-driven projects  
â€¢ Exploring real-world problems through experimentation and iteration

Always learning, always shipping â€” one dataset at a time.

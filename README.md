## Hi there 👋 I'm Dexun!

I'm a Data Science & Analytics student at NUS, passionate about building scalable systems and translating messy data into meaningful impact. My work sits at the intersection of data, product, and people — from deploying NLP bots to designing full-stack dashboards and working on user-facing automations.

🧠 **Currently working on**:  
• A Reddit sentiment monitoring bot using BERT + PyTorch  
• Optimizing end-to-end data pipelines with BigQuery + Tableau  
• Bridging the gap between technical tools and business needs  

🌱 **Currently learning**:  
• A/B testing and causal inference in product decisions  
• Recommender systems and live experimentation techniques  
• Product thinking and prioritization frameworks  

🤝 **Looking to collaborate on**:  
• Data-driven tools with real-world application  
• Early-stage product ideas with strong analytical backbones  
• Anything involving cloud, dashboards, or automation  

💬 **Ask me about**:  
• GCP, SQL, Tableau, and workflow automation  
• Cross-functional communication between tech and business  
• How I reduced cloud costs and debugged a WhatsApp survey system

🎯 **Fun fact**:  
I once built a fully automated messaging system... and accidentally mass-sent 100+ texts in testing. We fixed it. 😅

Always building — one script, dashboard, or conversation at a time.
